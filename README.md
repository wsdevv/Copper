**********************************

# Status 
- Lexer is being rewritten, goals are being changed, and some files are currently empty. I am Trying to start the project back up, currently uncompilable and unusable.
- Changed back to origional name (I don't know why I changed it anyway)

# Copper
A Open source compiled programming language, In development.
(Note: I failed to specify this earlier, but this is a personal project, and there are no guarentees  that it will ever be completed)

NOTICE:
- Copper is in early development, pardon me if files and programming are messy. Some operations may also not work.

# Goals
Copper is an general-purpose OOP language.

PaintLs main goal is to allow easy editability of its syntax, so programmers are in total control of how their programming
language looks without having to make their own. You will not have to download the source code to make changes to the language.

Example:

Change the normal declaration of a variable in PaintL:

```var myvar = "hello, world!" ```

To a python-like syntax:

```myvar = "hello, world!"```

Other goals
- make the programming language easy with a low learning curve.
- make the programming language fast. 
- make the programming language secure.
- make a transpiler: projects are transpiled to and from a global standard syntax so everyone can understand the base code.
